This project was built as a quick and dirty prototype for a coding contest. 
The code was hacked together and does not follow any good coding practices and may make you hate me. Don't hate me. 
Even hard-coded values are littered around the project.
Clean up is one of the big TODO items on the list come this summer!

[Still Hackathons rock! We would rather stay up all night building cool stuff, drinking diet coke and gorging on pizza - than sit at boring long meetings drawing UML diagrams!]

Use at your own risk and assess the implementation with a grain of salt!
